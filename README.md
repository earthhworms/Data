My name is Michael Salgado. This repository is a collection of small and large projects I've worked on through my development as a data anlyst

This repository is meant to be a collection of Jupyter notebooks using Python and it's libraries; Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, etc. to manipulate, visualize, and clean data. 
Similarly, it is also meant to have SQL projects to further explore said data using a more efficient and diverse tool.

As a means to maintain, improve, and ultimately hone my skills, I hope to use this repository to show consistency in my discipline of deep, undistracted work towards my goals. 
Becoming a undeniably great programmer is my main goal.
