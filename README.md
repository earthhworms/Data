My name is Michael Salgado. This repository is a collection of small and large projects I've worked on through my development as a data anlyst

This repository is meant to be a collection of Jupyter notebooks using Python and it's libraries; Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, etc. to manipulate, visualize, and clean data. 
Furthermore, it is also meant to have SQL projects to further explore said data using a more efficient and diverse tool.
