- Python
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Tableau
- Pandas

  

## Projects

### [Project 1: Financial Analysis](https://github.com/earthhworms/Data/blob/main/Python/FinanceProject.py)

Python visualization and analysis project. In this project, I import a handful of stocks and see their progression through the financial crisis of 2007-08. These stocks span from 2006-16, and I utilize tools such as Matplotlib and Pandas to build heatmaps and graphs. In this project I ask and answer questions such as:
- Why is the Citigroup highest, and lowest single day return so close to eachother?
- What is the rolling 30 day average against the close price of Bank of America?

### [Project 2: 911 Call Analysis](https://github.com/earthhworms/Data/blob/main/Python/911-Call-Analysis.py)

In this project I analyze data from 911 calls and find trends. I make graphs to show things such as:
- What are the most common reasons for 911 calls?
- Which reasons are most common for each day of the week?
- Which reasons are most common for each month
- Heatmaps for finding which hour and day of the week has the most activity for 911 calls.
